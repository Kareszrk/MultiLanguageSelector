# MultiLanguageSelector - Native/Vanilla JavaScript (Client only)
My very simple method on how to change the website's language without even a single page refresh. Client friendly. No useless javascript running code.

## This code supports the following:
- You can apply your own language: WelcomeText to whatever element you want. E.g. headers, paragraphs, anchors, buttons, etc...

Usage as attribute on HTML element: **data-languagePartIdentifier="WelcomeText"**

- You can apply your own language: WelcomeText on any placeholder

Usage as attribute on HTML element: **data-placeholder="WelcomeText"**

- You can apply your own language WelcomeText on any tooltip (This feature requires bootstrap 5 to be loaded)

Usage as attribute on HTML element: **data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-languagePartIdentifier="WelcomeText"**
